I have always dreamed about opening up my own coffee shop / bookstore in the Metro Vancouver Region of British Columbia, Canada. In this project, we will find the best neighbourhood(s) to open up a coffee shop with a bookstore in the Metro Vancouver Region. \n\nUsing Foursquare data and postal code data from Wikipedia, we will find out which regions have clusters of businesses that do not currently have a coffee shop and bookstore.
